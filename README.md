# CS Club @ SJSU Web site

The github page for this project can be found at [https://github.com/eblume/CS-Club-Site-at-SJSU](https://github.com/eblume/CS-Club-Site-at-SJSU).

## About this project

The site is implemented as a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) project. It uses markdown, primarily, to format its pages. The project is still in its infancy and we have not yet identified all of the technologies we wish to use, nor all the functionality we wish to implement.

## How to test the site

Testing the site in a local deployment (not meant for production release) is very simple, almost suspiciously so.

Follow [these very simply instructions (link)](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install) to install jekyll. (Summary: on most machines, just `sudo gem install jekyll`.) Then, in the root project directory, run:

    $ jekyll --serve

Then point your browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). It should be running!
